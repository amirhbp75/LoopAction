# Why did I develop this?
Once upon a time, I worked as a soldier in one of the departments of the Ministry of Science and Research. One day, I was given a list of names and was told to write a letter with a specific text for each of these individuals and send them a message with a specific text. Because I despise repetitive tasks, I developed this code to expedite my work.
